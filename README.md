1.	Python Anaconda Setup
Go to https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
Pull down to Anaconda 2019.10 for Windows Installer. Choose the operating system in your computer Windows, macOS, or Linux. Select Python 3.7 version, 64-Bit Graphical Installer. Download Anaconda installation application. After download, double click to install Anaconda in your computer.
Review: Top 20 Python libraries for data science in 2018: https://medium.com/activewizards-machine-learning-company/top-20-python-libraries-for-data-science-in-2018-2ae7d1db8049
2.	Git Setup
Install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
3.	Set up a Github Account
Go to www.github.com to set up your account if you don’t have a Github account yet. We will use Github to download popular machine learning study materials and projects, as well as turn in your projects in Github. 
4.	Install Sublime Text
Go to http://sublimetextcn.com/. Click “Download for Windows 64bit” and install it. 
We will learn how to edit Markdown document in Sublime Text for your project writeup. 
5.	Computer and Internet
Bring your computer every class and make sure internet is available.
6.	Book and Materials
We will use “Python机器学习及实践：从零开始通往Kaggle竞赛之路” by 范淼 & 李超 as our class conference book. The python codes in this book will be used in class. The code can be downloaded from https://github.com/godfanmiao/DIY_ML_Systems_with_Python_1st_Edition. Try to use Git to download it instead of downloading directly from Github website. Under Git and the directory you want the downloaded folder to be located at, type 
“git clone https://github.com/godfanmiao/DIY_ML_Systems_with_Python_1st_Edition”. You can buy this book from website if necessary.
See You All in Class!

The following link includes several project examples you can pick to do your Project 1.

The following is project we will use in the final class: 

1. LeNet-Lab Project

git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LeNet-Lab 

or download from github website.


The following is the project for Project 2.

2. Traffic Sign Classifier Project

git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project


For Project 2, you can choose either LeNet-Lab Project or Traffic Sign Classifier Project

Happy New Year everyone!

For Project 2 update, you can choose either https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LeNet-Lab  or https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project to start your Project 2. Both are the pratices of LeNet, the latter is more complicated and advanced, and is involved more with transportation. If you like challenges, I would sugguest you choose the latter for Traffic Sign Classifier.

The package of Traffic Sign Classifier Project at Udacity github only includes the Jupyter Notebbok file, Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb, without the completed scrits. I uploap a version of Traffic_Sign_Classifier project in my github account at https://github.com/peter-c12/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project so you can do this project based on what I provide. I don't ask you to do the whole project from Udacity version which needs more works; I ask you to do the work based on my version to test and develop different CNN structure. For example, increase or decrease convolution layers, define valid or same padding, or test max or average pooling, etc, and see if you can get higher accuracy. If your answer is worse, don't worry, discuss and write what you think why it happens in your writeup. I don't focus on your accuracy, but more on your modified scripts and your discussion in writeup. The same guideance is applied if you choose first option (LeNet-Lab Project) for Project 2. 

For writeup, from the presentation of Project 1, many sudents used something from website and discuss the content step by step, which is fine, but what I would like to see is to see you prepare about one page writing on your thought for this project, what weired thing happens and why. You don't need to exmaplin everything but focus on your questions and solutions, and finally, your take-awaay (心得/结论) from the project. 

Either Chinese or English is OK for Writeup, though English is prepferred. If your writeup is written in English, you let your work open to the market of the whole world.

For the students who registered the class, you have to finish Project 1 and Project 2, upload the files to your github account and send your github link to Professor Zhu by the due day, February 7, 2020. 

Thank you and hope you enjoy the Machine Learning!

Note: 
1. If you go to https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project , you can see there are over 1,800 forks. Some forks are just the same as the Udacity verion without any ToTo scripts completed; however, some users have their own scripts completed and writup. Those are huge resources you can reference.

2. I see some students forked "machine learning and transportation" repository from my github account. Please note that when you fork any repository, you copy the version at that time and this repository becomes yours in your account. Once the orginal author changes anything, such as the READme.md update I am working on, the repository in your account is still the version you forked. You may receive an email notice if you set receving notice when the repository you foked has any update and you may do the update.

3. One more thing, if your Project 2 with Traffic Sign Classifier has better result and would like to commit your changes to me and start a pull requeest, and finally I agree your changes and add your edits into my repository, you will get benefits on (1) much higher grade for this class, and (2) you will have a great pull request record in your github account, which is beneficial to your future career.
