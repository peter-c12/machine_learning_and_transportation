2.	Git Setup
Install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
3.	Set up a Github Account
Go to www.github.com to set up your account if you don’t have a Github account yet. We will use Github to download popular machine learning study materials and projects, as well as turn in your projects in Github. 
4.	Install Sublime Text
Go to http://sublimetextcn.com/. Click “Download for Windows 64bit” and install it. 
We will learn how to edit Markdown document in Sublime Text for your project writeup. 
5.	Computer and Internet
Bring your computer every class and make sure internet is available.
6.	Book and Materials
We will use “Python机器学习及实践：从零开始通往Kaggle竞赛之路” by 范淼 & 李超 as our class conference book. The python codes in this book will be used in class. The code can be downloaded from https://github.com/godfanmiao/DIY_ML_Systems_with_Python_1st_Edition. Try to use Git to download it instead of downloading directly from Github website. Under Git and the directory you want the downloaded folder to be located at, type 
“git clone https://github.com/godfanmiao/DIY_ML_Systems_with_Python_1st_Edition”. You can buy this book from website if necessary.
See You All in Class!
